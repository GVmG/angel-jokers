# Installation
You will need to install [Lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector) for this mod to run, as well as [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods/wiki). Additionally, this mod requires the [Malverk](https://github.com/Eremel/Malverk) texture manager mod.

Once you've installed those, download the [latest release](https://github.com/GVmG/angel-jokers/releases/latest) of this mod - it will be a .zip archive containing all the files for the mod to work.

Extract those files to your `%appdata%/balatro/Mods` folder so that the main.lua file is inside the `angels` folder. Make sure it's not in a subfolder! The file structure should be as follows: `%appdata%/balatro/Mods/angels/main.lua`

Once that's done, launch Balatro, and you can enable the textures from your settings>textures page. Enjoy your new textures!
